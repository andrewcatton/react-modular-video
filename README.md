# react-modular-video

Full readme coming soon. The goal with this project was to build a player that could be customized to fit any use case, and  have modularity to be as lightweight as possible. All of the player controls are (or will be) replaceable, toggleable, rearrangeable, and practically any other word ending in "able". This project was inspired by ['video-react'](https://video-react.js.org/). If you want a solid video player with little configuration OOTB, click that link.

Test out the functionality on the ['demo page'](https://stevengresh.com/react-modular-video)
Demo code can be found under `example/app.tsx`
